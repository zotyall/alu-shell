# This script groups visitors by IP and HTTP status code
# It counts occurrences and sorts from highest to lowest
# Only awk is used for parsing (no while, for, until, cut)

# Explanation:
# $1 -> IP address
# $9 -> HTTP status code
# We combine them as a key and count occurrences
# Then print count, IP and status
# Finally sort numerically in reverse order
